           To help industries avoid heavy upfront investment, we offer a unique "Steam at Cost" model, under which we install and maintain the steam boiler infrastructure and charge only for the steam consumed. In addition to plant installation, Mago Thermal offers expert engineering consultancy, capacity upgrades, combustion system modifications, and full-scale operation and maintenance services to ensure continuous and efficient performance. We also prioritize environmental sustainability by integrating advanced air pollution control systems such as Electrostatic Precipitators, Bag Filters, Flue Gas Desulphurisation units, and Wet Scrubbers into our plants.
